Zeeman ray tracer adapted to protoplanetary disks

Lankhaar & Teague 2023

Here we present the source code of the rigorous polarized radiative transfer simulations 
that comprise a part of Lankhaar & Teague (2023) (A&A ...).

in './cyllindric_V.py' one finds a collection of python functions that are used for the 
polarized radiative transfer simulations.

in './data' one finds the molecular data files (in numpy arrays) for the CN molecule, 
as well as a summary of the results of LIME simulations which are used in the Zeeman
resolved radiative transfer scheme.

The jupyter notebook 'Figs-6-8-10.ipynb' is a docment that illustrates the usage of the
routines from './cyllindric_V.py' and a prescription to obtain Figures 6, 8 and 10 in 
Lankhaar & Teague (2023) (A&A ...).
